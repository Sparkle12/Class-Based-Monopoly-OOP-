# Monopoly


- [ ] Class based Monopoly-like game made in C++ using SFML to create the visual interface.
- [ ] In its current state the game is played as a 1v1 against a bot. All the usual Monopoly activities are possible
  like buying properties, building houses, paying rent if you land on an owned property, chance, luxury tax and others.
- [ ] The behavior of the bot is quite simple, it buys any property it can.
- [ ] There are 3 available classes right now: Banker, Thief and Mage. Each one of them having a unique ability to use
  throughout the game
- [ ] The abilities are as follows:
- The Banker gains 200$ (can be used once per game).
- The Thief steals 100$ from the bot (can be used once per game).
- The Mage moves the bot 2 tiles behind (can be used 3 times per game).
- [ ] Sadly the only way to change you class is directly in the code, the default class being the Banker.
